# SkylandersSpyrosAdventure_Manual
Manual Archipelago world for Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure

This manual requires a new save and at least one Skylander of each element. Any Skylanders you do not own or do not\
want to use should be included in the characters_to_exclude yaml option. Currently, you start with one random Skylander\
and the first chapter unlocked. Depending on the chosen goal, you either need to defeat Kaos in Chapter 22 or get 3\
stars on every level (essentially, complete everything). 

[TOC]

## Required Hardware/Software

- Dolphin or another emulator that supports the Portal of Power, or a playable PC/console copy of the game. At least one\
Skylander from each element is manditory.

## Installation Procedures

- Set up like you would any other multiworld. Place the apworld in the custom_worlds folder of the Archipelago client\
with all other multiworlds, place this and all other yamls in the players folder, open the Archipelago client and click\
Generate. A complete guide can be found in the manual Discord server <a href=https://discord.com/channels/1097532591650910289/1163846227570462820/1163846227570462820>here</a>.

## Traps
* Element Lock Trap - Upon starting a level, you can only use Skylanders of the same element as the one you began the\
level with. Effect ends on level completion.
* Solo Trap - Upon starting a level, you may notuse any other Skylanders or active items until you beat the level or\
are defeated. 
* Rename Character Trap - Joke trap. Upon receipt, you must rename the last Skylander played using a name of the\
sender's choosing.
* Reset Last Character Trap - Hard Trap. Upon receipt, you must delete all data associated with the last Skylander\
used. Level, money, and upgrades are reset.



## Ideas for the Future
* ~~add chests as locations~~
* ~~fairy gems as items~~
* upgrade fairy as an item?
* pacifist trap (only kill necessary enemies on next level and restart if you fail)
* I don't want to add story scrolls because you rarely have to stray from the main path to get them. In my opinion,\
most collectable locations should require *some* effort to reach
